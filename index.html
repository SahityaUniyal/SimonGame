                <p>The principle of the game is simple: <br><br> The player have to memorize the series of illuminated keys and reproduce it. The purpose of the game is to reproduce the longest series of colors/sounds randomly generated by the Simon. In
                    each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes increasingly difficult because the player's memory is more and more solicited.

                <ol>
                    <li> At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The player has to press the same key.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li> If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!</li>
